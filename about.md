  Hey there! I'm a web-developer from Pune, India. I write code.
</p>

I'm not on an expert level yet. But I'm trying. I believe I have a great taste. My code isn't of elite cateory yet. But I'm working my way through it. I love my taste in <cite>code</cite> and <cite>design</cite>. And I'll reach upto it one day. Till that day I'm gonna do what I've always done - <strong>TRY</strong>.
